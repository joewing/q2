# Q2 Language Compiler

A compiler for a simple language for the Q2 (Q2L).

See [joewing.net/projects/q2/q2l](https://joewing.net/projects/q2/q2l) for
more information.

## Building

* q2lc is written in Rust, so the first step is to
  [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  (note that rustup will also install cargo, which is required).
* Once rust and cargo are installed, run `cargo build`
  from this directory.
* q2lc will be available as `target/debug/q2lc`, which can
  be used from this location or copied to a location in your path.
