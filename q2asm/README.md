# Q2 Assembler

q2asm is an assembler for Q2 programs.

See [joewing.net/projects/q2/asm](https://joewing.net/projects/q2/asm)
for more information.

## Building

* q2asm is written in Rust, so the first step is to
  [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  (note that rustup will also install cargo, which is required).
* Once rust and cargo are installed, run `cargo build`
  from this directory.
* q2asm will be available as `target/debug/q2asm`, which can
  be used from this location or copied to a location in your path.
