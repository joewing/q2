# Q2A

Hardware for the Q2 12-bit computer made from programmable logic devices.
Compared to the original Q2, the Q2A should be easier to have fabricated
(it uses through-hole components making it easy to hand assemble). In
addition, the Q2A has a faster clock and a nicer enclosure.

Note that the current iteration of the Q2A does not support the memory
extension device or I2C.
